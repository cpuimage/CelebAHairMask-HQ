# CelebAHairMask-HQ

**CelebAHairMask-HQ** is a *extended dataset* of CelebAMask-HQ for hair segmentation or hair matting.

**CelebAMask-HQ** is a large-scale face image dataset that has **30,000** high-resolution face images selected from the CelebA dataset by following CelebA-HQ. Each image has segmentation mask of facial attributes corresponding to CelebA.

The masks of CelebAHairMask-HQ were auto-annotated with the size of **1024 x 1024**. 

CelebAHairMask-HQ can be used to **train and evaluate algorithms of hair segmentation, hair recognition, and GANs for hair generation and editing**.
